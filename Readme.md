The Best Quiz Ever

This homework was a good challenge! I got a little ahead of myself and tried to make multiple quizes using different methods and that ended up making my head spin. I am happy I did that though, because it pushed me to learn more.

I started this homework by creating the HTML.
I created the class container and built all of my elements off of that main bracket. 
I had read targeting more elements can make this process easier, so I went ahead an made a class for everything I thought i would need.
I added my buttons on my HTML and I moved on to the JavaScript.
I started my Jave by identifying my HTML elements.
then I added my button variables.
I followed that by adding my questions variables.
Then I set the quiz variables, like the timer, timerintervals and so on. 

Next, I needed to create a function for the quiz to start. I do that by creating the startQuiz button function to activate the quiz while hidding the start page. I created the generate quiz function that identifies all elements to create quiz, like the if statment that looks for the first questions to the last that way it can return a score eventually. I also aligned the buttons with there choices for answers.

After that I, create a function to start the quiz by fetching a questions through the generatequiz function and stating my timer interval so that the timer starts.

Now, I need create the check answer function. That way I can make sure the right button is being targeted for the right answer. Also in this section I am setting the timerleft element that will subtract 10 seconds if the wrong answer is selected.

Next, comes the score function. This fuction creates the score for the user bahind the scene, and this is also where I have the user input the initials so they can add there score to the localstorage data, and alert them they must add there initials.

Then, it is time to generate the high scores page. This will take the information from the section above and put it all together for the highscores page. That way the user will be able to see there score vs other users scores.

The last bit for the JavaScript is to create the tryAgian function to let the user start over, and the clearScores function to let the user clear localstorage. 

The last thing to do is style the page and that's it. I will say I changed the style so much I lost track between the multiple projects i was working on. But I think the final product looks good.
